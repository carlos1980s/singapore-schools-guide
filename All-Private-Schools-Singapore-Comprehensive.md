## SECTION 8: ERROR ANALYSIS & DATA GAPS

### Errors Identified During Research:

1. **Fee Inconsistencies:**
   - Many madrasahs don't publish standardized fee schedules publicly
   - Actual fees vary significantly based on financial assistance
   - International school fees change annually (3-5% increase typical)

2. **Missing Data:**
   - Some private schools (especially religious and community) lack online presence
   - SAP school fees are standardized under MOE but IP programs have additional costs
   - Kindergarten fees vary significantly by location and program type

3. **Classification Ambiguities:**
   - Some schools span multiple categories (e.g., SAP + Catholic + Independent)
   - "Private" vs "Government-aided" distinction can be unclear
   - Some international schools have local Singaporean programs

4. **Currency & GST:**
   - Some schools quote without GST, others inclusive
   - All fees in this report include 9% GST where applicable

### Data Gaps to Address:
1. Complete fee schedules for all madrasahs with financial assistance calculations
2. Updated 2025-2026 fees for all international schools
3. More detailed information on Tamil community schools
4. Complete list of church-based kindergartens
