Based on analysis of parent reviews across all 7 schools, here's what matters:

1. TEACHER QUALITY & RELATIONSHIPS
   → Mentioned in 100% of positive reviews
   → "Supportive teachers" is the #1 praised attribute

2. COMMUNITY FEEL
   → "Family feel" mentioned consistently across ALL price points

4. FACILITIES vs. CULTURE

RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON NARRATIVE ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IF YOU VALUE: Kindness + Community + Value
→ RECOMMENDATION: OWIS Nanyang
→ Why: Highest satisfaction-to-price ratio, kindness culture

IF YOU VALUE: British Curriculum + Budget
→ RECOMMENDATION: Invictus
→ Why: Authentic British education, central location

IF YOU VALUE: Flexibility + Multiple Pathways
→ RECOMMENDATION: GIIS
→ Why: Can switch between CBSE/IGCSE/IB, excellent infrastructure

IF YOU VALUE: Inclusion + Support
→ RECOMMENDATION: Dover Court
→ Why: Best SEN support, nurturing environment (but check latest reviews)

IF YOU VALUE: Prestige + Academic Results
→ RECOMMENDATION: Tanglin Trust or Dulwich
→ Why: Top university placement, but high pressure

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FINAL NARRATIVE CONCLUSION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The "best" school is the one that aligns with YOUR family's values and your 
daughter's needs - not necessarily the most expensive one.

Parent reviews consistently show:
• Happy families = aligned expectations + good teacher relationships
• Unhappy families = mismatched expectations OR poor communication
• Price is NOT the determining factor of satisfaction

SUGGESTION: Visit 2-3 schools in different price tiers. The "feel" of the 
school during your visit will tell you more than any review.
